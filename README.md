# About OpenFHE-rs
☀️ *OpenFHE-rs is a joint project by [FairMath](https://fairmath.xyz/) & [OpenFHE](https://www.openfhe.org/)*

---

OpenFHE-rs is a Rust interface for the OpenFHE library. OpenFHE is known for its wide range of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes, 
all implemented in C++. We're bringing this capability to Rust developers.

By offering a Rust wrapper for OpenFHE, we make it easier for Rust devs to use advanced FHE schemes in their projects. 
Whether you're building secure data processing apps or privacy-focused tools, OpenFHE-rs helps you do that with the power of OpenFHE's encryption technology.

# Current status

The library is under development and the ETA is Q2 2024.
